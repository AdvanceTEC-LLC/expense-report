# Project Name

## Description

This project is a TypeScript-based application that includes ESLint for linting and code quality, with configurations tailored for TypeScript, React, and Vitest for testing. The configuration ensures strict type checking, consistent coding styles, and proper handling of TypeScript files across the application, including test files.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js (preferably the latest LTS version)
npm or Yarn
TypeScript
ESLint

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
cd <project-directory>
npm install
```

or if you're using Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### TypeScript Configuration

tsconfig.json: Base TypeScript configuration for the project.
tsconfig.app.json: Configuration for the application code.
tsconfig.node.json: Configuration for Node.js related files.

### ESLint Configuration

ESLint is configured to lint TypeScript and React files. The configuration includes rules for consistent coding style, best practices, and type safety:

Strict Type Checking: Ensures no unused variables or parameters.
React Rules: Enforces best practices in React components.
Stylistic Rules: Enforces consistent style like semicolons and strict assignment checks.
The ESLint configuration includes support for TypeScript (typescript-eslint), React hooks (eslint-plugin-react-hooks), and React Refresh (eslint-plugin-react-refresh).

### Linting

To run ESLint on your project files:

```bash
npm run lint
```

This command will check for any linting issues based on the rules defined in .eslintrc.js.

### Testing

The project uses Vitest for testing. Test files are located in the tests/ directory and are automatically included in the configuration.

To run the tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

### Scripts

npm run lint: Run ESLint to check for code quality issues.
npm run test: Run the tests with Vitest.
